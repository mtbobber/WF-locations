Data mining project using predictive modeling to identify potential new Wholefoods locations using US Census Data
I am second year graduate student at University of Chicago. This repository contains code for a Data Mining project where we used publically available US Census data, GIS data, and web-scraped data to predict possible Whole Foods locations within the US - based on various feature engineering.
